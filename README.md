# Integer Overflow Bug in C This repository demonstrates a simple integer overflow bug in a C program.  The code attempts to assign a value to an integer that exceeds its maximum possible value. The solution demonstrates how to address this issue by using data types which handle larger values and adding checks to prevent integer overflow.## How to reproduce the bug Compile and run the code in `bug.c` to see the unexpected behavior of the integer overflow.
